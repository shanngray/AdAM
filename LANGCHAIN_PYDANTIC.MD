# LangChain Pydantic

Module: `langchain_core.pydantic_v1`

## BaseModel
`BaseModel` is a class that serves as the base class for all data models in LangChain. It inherits from the `pydantic.BaseModel` class, which is a powerful data validation and parsing library for Python. The `BaseModel` class provides a way to define data structures with type annotations and validation rules, making it easier to work with structured data in LangChain.

Here are the arguments and keyword arguments for `BaseModel`:

- `__root__` (Optional[Any]): This argument is used to specify the root value of the model. It's typically not used directly.
- `**data` (Any): This is a catch-all argument that allows you to pass in key-value pairs to initialize the model's fields.

The `Field` class is used to define the fields of a `BaseModel`. It allows you to specify the data type, validation rules, and other metadata for each field in the model.

## Field
Here are the arguments and keyword arguments for `Field`:

- `default` (Optional[Any]): This argument specifies the default value for the field if no value is provided.
- `default_factory` (Optional[Callable[[], Any]]): This argument allows you to provide a callable function that will be used to generate the default value for the field.
- `alias` (Optional[str]): This argument specifies an alternative name for the field when it's serialized or deserialized.
- `title` (Optional[str]): This argument provides a human-readable title or description for the field.
- `description` (Optional[str]): This argument allows you to provide a more detailed description of the field.
- `const` (Optional[Any]): This argument specifies a constant value that the field must have.
- `gt` (Optional[Any]): This argument specifies that the field value must be greater than the provided value.
- `ge` (Optional[Any]): This argument specifies that the field value must be greater than or equal to the provided value.
- `lt` (Optional[Any]): This argument specifies that the field value must be less than the provided value.
- `le` (Optional[Any]): This argument specifies that the field value must be less than or equal to the provided value.
- `multiple_of` (Optional[float]): This argument specifies that the field value must be a multiple of the provided value.
- `max_length` (Optional[int]): This argument specifies the maximum length of the field value (for string fields).
- `min_length` (Optional[int]): This argument specifies the minimum length of the field value (for string fields).
- `pattern` (Optional[str]): This argument specifies a regular expression pattern that the field value must match.
- `**extra` (Any): This is a catch-all argument that allows you to pass in additional keyword arguments for the field.

Here's an example of how you might define a `BaseModel` with several fields using `Field`:
```
from typing import List
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field

class Book(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="The title of the book.")
    author: str = Field(description="The author of the book.")
    pages: int = Field(gt=0, description="The number of pages in the book.")
    genres: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="The genres of the book.")
```

In this example, we define a Book model with four fields:

 - **title**: A string field representing the title of the book.
 - **author**: A string field representing the author of the book.
 - **pages**: An integer field representing the number of pages in the book. It has a validation rule that requires the value to be greater than 0.
 - **genres**: A list of strings representing the genres of the book. It has a default value of an empty list.

You can create an instance of the Book model like this:
```
book = Book(title="The Great Gatsby", author="F. Scott Fitzgerald", pages=180, genres=["Fiction", "Classic"])
```

The BaseModel and Field classes from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 provide a powerful and flexible way to define and validate data structures in LangChain. They help ensure data consistency and make it easier to work with structured data throughout the LangChain codebase.
